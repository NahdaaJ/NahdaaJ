<h2 align="center">♡ About Me ♡</h2>
<p>
  🌸 I'm a Mechatronics & Robotics Engineering graduate from the University of Sheffield,<br>
  now working as a Software Engineer with a focus on growth, creativity, and clean code.<br><br>

  ♥ I’m self-taught in C#, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  
  ♥ At work, I work with C#, .NET 8.0, Angular, ASP. NET Core as well as DevOps principles.
  
  ♥ I also have experience with relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL, and tools like Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions.
  
  ♥ I enjoy building practical desktop apps with WPF and SQLite or websites using HTML, CSS and JS, and I’m passionate about blending aesthetics with functionality.
  
  ♥ Currently learning more about software architecture, clean coding practices, and full-stack development!

  <br />
  🐇 Outside of tech, I love fantasy books, gaming (Akali best girl ♥), and tinkering with habit trackers or productivity tools!<br>
